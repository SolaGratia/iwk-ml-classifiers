Machine learning assignment: Classifier implementation

Starting with this one, I am uploading my solutions to old exercises so I have a place where I (and everyone else) can easily access them for future reference.

This was the second assignment in the **Machine Learning for NLP** course that I took in 2015, as a part of the Master's Programme in Language Technology (Gothenburg University). The main point of the exercise/assignment was to implement the [Pegasos algorithm](http://www.cs.huji.ac.il/~shais/papers/ShalevSiSrCo10.pdf) for training SVMs. The original instructions are [**here**](https://svn.spraakdata.gu.se/repos/richard/pub/ml2015_web/assignment2.html) (but *please* do not bother my old prof about this).
